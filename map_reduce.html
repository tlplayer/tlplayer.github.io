<center><h1>Map & Reduce</h1></center>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
In 2004 Google engineers tried lots of methods to parallelize their processes.<br>
They implemented Map and Reduce. Which drastically increased the efficiency for finding documents<br>
and processing the whole internet. The algorithm worked by using a list of Map functions supplied to the algorithm.<br>
The algorithm would then create key value lists that would be fed into the reduce functions.

<h2>Technical Concepts</h2>
<p>
The language used for this project was Go. Go maps well to threaded server management<br>
For a couple of reasons, 1. It's garbage collected to avoid thread waiting for collecting memory<br>
Go is faster than Java because it is compiled. And Go was the supplied starter code and I did not want <br>
To start this from scratch.
