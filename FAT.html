<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This is a school assignment so I don't feel like an extremely thorough explaination <br>
of the system is academically honest. So The explaination here is lacking. The Lab documentation at the bottom in<br>
sources should cover most of the topic I'm going to move onto assignments from other universities so I don't get expelled.<p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Memory for large datacenters was originally stored on large disks with laser scanners on them.<br> 
The memory would be broken up into sectors containing a number of bytes. To make this more efficient<br>
a File allocation table was created. A FAT is a memory storage structure that uses an index table of corresponding disk <br>
blocks to store files efficiently.They are still used in devices that require memory efficiency over file access speed, like NXP boards.<br>
</p>

<h2>Technical Concepts</h2>
<p>
A FAT is technically challenging to implement. Sectors are stored in a scheme where the first sectors<br>
act as indices to blocks. The blocks that are indexed to in the table are then linked to different indices.<br>

<p>
In this example the table starts at sector 0. The files can occupy the 9 others.<br>
The first available sector is 1 if the file needs more memory than sector 1 occupies it will proceeed to 1's<br>
link in the FAT. 7 is the next sector that is free. It will continue until either<br>
A. The sectors have adequately stored the file<br>
B. The last sector is used in which case the file cannot be stored and should nothing should be written to any sector.<br>
