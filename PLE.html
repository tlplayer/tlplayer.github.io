<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
When someone wants to build a catalog of items in an online store<br>
they want to show the user items of similar style i.e. if someone is looking for shoes,<br>
they might want Nike's or Addidas black sneakers. The challenge is creating such a catalog<br>
Machine Learning is well suited to do this task, but human labelers are not the best at such a specific caategorization<br>
Therefore labeled data is limited and thus the challenge starts getting messy. <br>

<h2>Technical Concepts</h2>
<p>
The first problem is the limited amount of labeled data. Deep learning is notoriously data hungry.<br>
Meaning to optimise the function f(D) which returns the PLE of the data (D) it needs a lot of labeled data.<br>
In order to further classify the data it must be split into clusters based off of intrensic characteristics of the image.<br>
Such as color makeup, shape composition, etc.<br>
These mapping functions (See map reduce for how to get this into production) simplifies the categorization challenge from 1/1000 to 1/10.<br>
This magnitude of difference in the probability of correctly categorizing the item is HUGE. <br>
Next one needs to find a neural network that is good with categorizing <br>
